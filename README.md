AJANE (Asynchronous Javascript and Nothing Else)

Ajax (now superseded by fetch) conventionally retrieved data from the server, asynchronously.

But what if you simply want to load and execute a javascript, asynchronously?

AJANE (Asynchronous Javascript and Nothing Else) is a function which, straightforwardly, enables a <script> element to be added to the end of the DOM which wasn't present when the document was initially loaded.
  
## Example:
`code here`
